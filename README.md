Due to complications with the ALL OF US Research Workbench, we had to restructure our code into 2 individual notebooks, one for each drug, Clopidogrel and Warfarin.

Within each notebook, we first start with the data collection using the autogenerated code provided by the Research workbench pertaining to each drug. Afterwards, we move forward into our data wrangling portion, where we combine overlapping patients within those who were administered the drug and exhibited the conditions. Following this section we have the Visualizations and Data Analaysis section, where we create a series of figures and tables in order to analyze specific trends and identify key features. In the final section, we have the Machine Learning portion where we created a Random Forest and a Logistic Regression model for each of the drugs and conducted validation and accuracy tests utilizing AUC ROC scores and precision recall rates.
